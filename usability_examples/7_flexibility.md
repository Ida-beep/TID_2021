# Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

## Examples

### Ida
Silly example of unneccesary design detail, that does not support that basic needs of a table i.e. being stable and safe to put your things on. Perhaps this coffee setup will do ok with some wobbling, but it's very limited what you can place there. It does give the user some more fun in their everyday coffee routine.
